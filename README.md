# Triangles
Web API project
Choose your best example of your skills 
 
Your sample should be developed as a C# Web Api endpoint with an optional JavaScript front end and should be posted to GitHub for review. Please provide your recruiter with the link for the source code.  If preferable, you can opt for a light technical exercise on a white board at the time of the technical interview.   
 
Geometric layouts 
 
1.A - The task, calculate the triangle coordinates for an image with right triangles such that for a given row (A-F) and column (1-12) you can produce any of the triangles in the layout below: 

 
Each non-hypotenuse side of the triangle is as follows: 
 
 
1.B - Lastly, given the vertex coordinates, calculate the row and column for the triangle: 
(V3x, V3y)
(V1x, V1y)
(V2x, V2y)
